                Information Commissioner.

                <h2>What is Personal Information, and why do we collect it?</h2>

                <p>We don’t guarantee website links or the Policy of authorised third parties. We collect your Personal

                    would reasonably
                    expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists anytime by

                    why we are
                    collecting the information and how we plan to use it.</p>

                <h2>Sensitive Information</h2>

                    Third Parties
                </h2>
                <p>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you.
                    However, in some
                    circumstances, third parties may provide us with information. In such a case, we will take
                    reasonable steps to ensure
                    that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.</p>

                <h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
                <p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed in several circumstances, including the following:

                <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
                <p>Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and
                    unauthorised
                    access, modification or disclosure. When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the
                    purpose for which it was
                    obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal
                    Information. However, most
                    Personal Information is or will be stored in client files, which we will keep for at least seven
                    years.</p>

                    certain exceptions.
                    If you wish to access your Personal Information, please contact us in writing.</p>
                <p>Qoos Pty Ltd will not charge any fee for your access request but may charge an administrative fee for
                    providing a copy
                    of your Personal Information. We may require your identification before releasing the requested
                    information to protect
                    your Personal Information.</p>

                <h2>Maintaining the Quality of your Personal Information</h2>
                <p>It is important to us that your Personal Information is up to date. We will take reasonable steps to
                    ensure your
                    Personal Information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you find that the information we have
                    is not up to date or
                    is inaccurate, please advise us as soon as practicable so we can update our records and ensure we
                    can continue to
